## Basic Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use the utilities:

```php
// Assumed you are using composer autoload

// Example usage of ArrayUtility
$array1 = [
    "name" => [
        "name" => "john",
        "surname" => "doe",
    ]
];
$array2 = [
    "email" => "johndoe@example.com",
    "name" => [
        "midname" => "washington"
    ]
];
$array3 = [
    "country" => "Germany",
    "city" => "Berlin",
];

$result = ArrayUtility::mergeInDepth($array1, $array2, $array3);

/*
$result => [
    "name" => [
        "name" => "john",
        "surname" => "doe",
        "midname" => "washington"
    ],
    "email" => "johndoe@example.com",
    "country" => "Germany",
    "city" => "Berlin",
];
*/

// Example usage of BooleanUtility
$bool = BooleanUtility.fromString("ON");

/*
$bool => true; 
*/

// Example usage of MathUtility

$matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
];

$result = MathUtility::qrDecompositionMatrix($matrix);

/*
$result => [
    [0.316227766, 0.948683298],
    [0.948683298, -0.316227766]
];
*/

// Example of SqlUtility
$table = "users";
$conditions = ["id", "=", 12];
$sql = SqlUtility::deleteQuery($table, $conditions);

/*
$sql => "DELETE FROM users WHERE id=12;";
*/

// Example of StringUtility
$string = "hello-wORLd";

$result = StringUtility::transformToPascalSnakecase($result);

/*
$result => "Hello_World";
*/
```
